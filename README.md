# 3D-reconstruction
In computer vision and computer graphics, 3D reconstruction is the process of capturing
the shape and appearance of real objects.3D data acquisition and object reconstruction can
be performed using stereo image pairs. The images acquisition can occur from a multitude of
methods including 2D images, acquired sensor data and on site sensors.
The process of 3D reconstruction has been divided into 3 main steps:
1. Image Acquisition
2. Camera Calibration
3. 3D-Reconstruction
